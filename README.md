this repo is madness

created in several hours and this is combine of forked https://github.com/vgarvardt/gue and
https://github.com/hibiken/asynqmon

in gue fixed long transactions and integrated asynqmon as interface

## this queue you can use in next cases:
- low/mid size of tasks in project
- long-time tasks
- persistent storage for tasks
- if you have postgres at project and don't want install rabbit/kafka/redis/temporal and other heavy services
